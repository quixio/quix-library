# Demo JSON data

[This project](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/json) JSON data into a topic from sample JSON data set.

The JSON data is a very small subset of data taken from the Demo Data CSV Code Sample. We have used this small data sample so you can see the data format more easily. 

The data is repeated 100 times to give you time to explore the platform with live data being published. You can increase or decrease this by changing the `iterations` variable.
