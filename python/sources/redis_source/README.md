# Redis Timeseries Source

Use the Redis time series library to query Redis and publish to a Kafka topic

Note that you need [Redis Stack](https://redis.io/docs/about/about-stack/) to use [this code sample](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/develop/python/sources/redis_source).

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up?xlink=github) account or log in and visit the Code Samples to use this project.

Clicking `Deploy` on the Sample, deploys a pre-built container in Quix. Complete the environment variables to configure the container.

Clicking `Edit code` on the Sample, forks the project to your own Git repo so you can customize it before deploying.

## Environment Variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **output**: This is the ouput topic that will receive the stream (Default: `output`, Required: `True`)
- **redis_host**: Host address for the Redis instance (Required: `True`)
- **redis_host**: Host address for the Redis instance (Required: `True`)
- **redis_port**: Port for the Redis instance (Default: `6379`, Required: `True`)
- **redis_password**: Password for the Redis instance (Default: `None`, Required: `False`)
- **redis_username**: Username for the Redis instance (Default: `None`, Required: `False`)


## Requirements / Prerequisites

You will need to have a Redis Stack database. Either you can use the [Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/cloud/overview/) or
you can install Redis locally. You can find the instructions to [install Redis locally](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-stack/).
