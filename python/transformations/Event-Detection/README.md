The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **input**: This is the input topic for f1 data.
- **output**: This is the output topic for hard braking events.

## Docs

Check out the [SDK docs](https://docs.quix.io/sdk-intro.html) for detailed usage guidance.

## How to run
Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up?xlink=github) account to edit or deploy this application without a local environment setup.

Alternatively, you can learn how to set up your local environment [here](https://docs.quix.io/sdk/python-setup.html).
