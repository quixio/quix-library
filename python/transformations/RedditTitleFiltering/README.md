# Subreddit title filter

[This project](https://github.com/quixio/quix-library/tree/main/python/transformations/RedditTitleFiltering) works with the [Reddit](https://github.com/quixio/quix-library/tree/main/python/sources/Reddit) connector and applies title filtering to allow only posts of interest.

## How to run

Create a [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up?xlink=github) account or log-in and visit the Library to use this project.

Clicking `Setup & deploy` on the library item, deploys a pre-built container in Quix. Complete the environment variables to configure the container.

Clicking `Edit code` on the library item, forks the project to your own Git repo so you can customize it before deploying.

## Environment variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **input**: This is the input topic for raw data.
- **output**: This is the output topic for filtered data.
- **subreddit**: This is the subreddit this filter will work with.
- **titlecontainsword**: This word to filter on.
