# Streaming demo project - Control

[This project](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/transformations/Demo.Data.Stream.Processing-Control) processes data from the input topic then sends `x,y` coordinates, `speed` and `angle` back to the output topic.

This is part of our [Car Demo](https://quix.io/data-stream-processing-example/) example, which your can try [here](https://quix.io/demos/cardemo/qr).
