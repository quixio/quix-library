# Fraud detection III - Prediction

[This project](https://github.com/quixio/quix-library/tree/main/python/transformations/Fraud-Detection-Predict) is the prediction stage for the fraud detection example. The prediction is performed with a loaded ML model from the cleaning data read.

## How to run

## Environment variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **input**: This is the input topic for cleaned fraud data.
- **output**: This is the output topic for fraud predictions.

## Requirements/prerequisites

This is part of the fraud detection project:

- Fraud detection I - Ingest: project that writes transaction data into topic.
- Fraud detection II - Cleaning: project that reads raw transaction data and cleans it (dummyfication). 
- Fraud detection III - Prediction (this one): project that writes the cleaned transaction data and uses it to predict fraud using a loaded machine learning model.
