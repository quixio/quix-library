# Awair Connector
This sample will connect to Awair's background services to continously scrape and publish data for your devices.

## Requirements

You will need to register for a [developer account](https://developer.getawair.com/onboard/welcome) to access your Awair data. Once you have that, you can get your access token from [here](https://developer.getawair.com/console/access-token).

## Environment variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **Topic**: This is the ouput topic where data will be written to.
- **Awair__Token**: The token needed to communicate with Awair API.

## Limitations
Due to the rate limit of the Awair endpoints, data will only be scraped when the application starts then every 5 minutes afterwards for the elapsed period.
