### Tokens

A quick note on PAT or Personal Access Tokens.

The PAT token used by default will expire. It is recommended that you generate a new token and update the `quix.service.ts` file. 

## Local

You will need to run both the UI and API.

You can run the API in Quix or locally as long as the UI has access to it.

 - Workspace ID - The id of your Quix workspace. See the URL in your browser when you're logged in
